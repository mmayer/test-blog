Title: Trying a Photo

# Attempt to post a picture via Dropbox

Here is a photo of yesterday’s sunset.

Finally working after a couple of false starts, but then I ended up deleting the image by accident.

Now, trying to get auto-regen going.

After lots of failures, it may now be functional. Sort of.

Here’s the image back.
