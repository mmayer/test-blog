# Trying out Mou with Scriptogr.am

I just hooked up Mou 0.7.5 (beta) with my Scriptogr.am account. Now, it's time to try out how posting to the blog works from within Mou.

Looks like all I have to do is hit Ctrl-Shift-S and, voila, what I wrote will show up on the blog. There does seem to be some caching or processing delay on the Scriptogr.am side, however. So, no getting impatient. :-) It may take five minutes or more.
