# Version Tracking with GIT

This blog post is the first post that is distributed to the server using Dropbox *and* automatically committed to the GIT repo there. I also turned on +git push+, so not only will the post be auto-committed, it will be auto-pushed into the master repo. 

In addition, I am trying out *categories* and *tags* to see if they work as intended.
