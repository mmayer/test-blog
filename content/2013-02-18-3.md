# Blogging from Opa

While waiting for our dinner to be cooked (pita wrap with chicken for Brigette and pita wrap combo with beef and fries for me) I am typing away on this blog post using iA Writer on my iPhone. Opa offering ShawOpen wifi makes waiting less boring. The network connection is quite fast.

As I type, I find that my setup is already working quite well. Incron is doing its job well, triggering a page re-build whenever Dropbox syncs files from my phone to my server. I still need to investigate more why only the +IN_OPEN+ seems to be triggered when Dropbox is updating the directory. That means, I also have to use +IN_NO_LOOP+ to prevent endless loops. While it works well enough, it still means that merely reading the files in the Dropbox folder will trigger the web server to rebuild the blog. So, itâ€™s not ideal, but still less overhead to configuring a traditional cron-job to run every two to five minutes.

I still need to familiarize myself with all the meta tags Pelican supports. Most important amongst those are *Drafts*, *Tags* and *Categories*. Marking posts as drafts while typing is beneficial, as the half-finished post won't just show up whenever iA Writer saves the file. (It would also work to keep the file in iCloud until I am done and move it in the end.)
