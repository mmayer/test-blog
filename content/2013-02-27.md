This is my first post written via the shared Dropbox account. All should still work as before. Incron still seems the best way to trigger re-gen. Dropbox’s RSS feed would be too cumbersome to use and also not detailed enough (needed information missing from the feed).

Now it’s time to fix up the theme.
